# RockPaperScissors
A simple game of Rock Paper Scissors


This is a project I began working on at the beginning of the school year. It uses lists and random integer generators to compare the choices of the person making the inputs and then decides who wins the game. It also allows you to play as many times as you want and keeps track of the record of wins, loses and ties.
